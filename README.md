Hello!
We are Microprocessor Group 4.
To implement a futuristic factory, we have designed a coexistence of a robot arm that mimics human arm movements in real time
and a collaborative robot that primarily sorts colored balls.
In the event of a collaborative robot error, humans can be alerted to the error and assist in its resolution.
